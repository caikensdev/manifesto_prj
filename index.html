<div id="text-holder"><p>There is a problem in art. It’s a problem in the world too, but I want to focus on art for a moment before jumping to the other forms. If there is a political body, there is art. This is a problem, because decentralizing art is a myth. Art and power have a complicated and combined history. Design and its derivatives are even worse. Art also supersedes power, Art is a part of our consciousness and it has a conversation with our psyche.</p>
<p>
Design, and its problematic relationship with power, is about an ethical ought. Art doesn’t have to answer these questions of power, it cannot be held accountable. Art as a body, as a thing that is made, has two philosophical questions that remain, pornography and suicide. That is, the existential problem of sexuality in the inanimate and the problem of nothingness in the infinite jest of the universe. Art is much broader than design. To be precise, design is about choices. Choices to manipulate, to articulate belief.

<h1> <i class="material-icons">child_care</i>The Garden<i class="material-icons">child_care</i></h1>
<p>The Garden represents two things, one this mystical place of beginnings, and the education of children.</p>

<p>It is the indoctrination of children to love the political body that is at the root of this problem of Common Forms. It’s impossible to separate the political body from children. Polis is part of our conscious self.</p>

<p>The Forms grow out of twofold realization. The first is that in order to be a Form there must be a community, one individual cannot define Form. This has never been done. The second, is that the Forms do not have an organic beginning in a materialist view of the world. Materiality is opposed to the Forms.</p>

<p>Forms are connected to the conscious, and as long as the consciousness is not the hardware, but is instead the software, if this consciousness is only a mere representation of reality, and if there is some hierarchy as it relates to this sense of forms, when the hardware learns to project itself from itself, the forms will not remain.</p>

<p>There is in these Forms, a desire to return to the Garden.This imaginative place is longed for, a place where the conscious self doesn’t experience pain, where pleasure and joy are real and meaningful aspects of our shared self. </p>

<p>John Lennon asked us to “imagine there’s no heaven, no hell beneath us, only sky above.” Return to design. Lennon designed a nightmare. If you, a person, embodied with consciousness stops longing for the Garden, that is the worst kind of depression. Lennon was so afraid of the possibility of suffering, that he gave up on the Garden.</p>
<h1><i class="material-icons">close</i>anthropocene<i class="material-icons">close</i></h1>
<p>It is not possible to live in crisis at all times. It is not possible for there to be both an emergency and for the homeostasis of earth to be maintained at the same time. An internal consciousness demands survival. The thing inside the quark, the form that forms the Forms. </p>
<h1><i class="material-icons">cloud_off</i>entering into the g/itch<i class="material-icons">cloud_off</i></h1>
<p>The fourth wave of feminism is evident. The fourth wave is about femme identification, femme trans bodies, femme as person. Femme as having real experience in a world that is digitally uploaded, downloaded, connected, tranmogrified. </p>
<p>
The glitch (g/litch) (g1itch) is from the German, ‘gleiten’, which means to slip. Slip implies friction, movement, spin at the particle level that is chaotic, likely non random, subject to evolution and growth. The glitch is not longer invisible. The glitch is no longer default. The glitch is now larger than systems of power.
</p>
<p>
If you resist the glitch it will find you, if you submit to the glitch you will be lost in the noise. If you continue to be one step ahead of the noise, whether straight, queer, femme, default, or ill you can’t be swallowed up in the noise. Define this world with your own words. They are all you have.
</p>
<h1><i class="material-icons">undo</i>experience over representation and materialist doctrine<i class="material-icons">undo</i></h1>
<p>Experience is valued over representation of queerness, blackness, whiteness, or another default. Not experiencing is worse than not representing. Consciousness is experience. Experience is consciousness. This is the only working solution to the hard problem of consciousness.
</p>
<h1><i class="material-icons">healing</i>The Theologian <i class="material-icons">healing</i></h1>
<p>The theologian celebrated the essay on the Garden. He or she said, thank you, that’s why we need God! I want for a moment to push back on the professional theologian.</p>
<p>We, as conscious beings, are all Theologians, adding direction, directives, and decisions for our lives in a three dimensional space. Sometimes we design God, sometimes we engage in the concept of God that another has given us, and sometimes we become theologians of the opposition. Antitheologians, like Christopher Hitchens. The boldness of these men and women I find commendable and fascinating. I think everyone believes in God unless they become convinced to be against the perception of God. </p>
<p>The argument from fine-tuning, the argument that Hitchens said, is the most difficult argument for him to dismantle, is better dismantled by the panpsychist than the materialist. If the materialist assumes that God exists, he is going to eventually see God as the originator of the Big Bang or whatever empirically verifiable systems are in place. For the panpsychist, to get to the very thing within the element, that is consciousness. Fine tuning comes from within the conscious. The consciousness is in all. The theologian or the antitheologian needs to quit bothering with materiality, and needs to approach the question of why are we fine tuned systems? Why is there a glitch? How do we respond to the divine, to the conscious, to where we are in the world? Those answers from the philosopher and how to scale this to the level of rationality, is how to win the war against the Common Forms.</p>
<h1><i class="material-icons">filter_vintage</i>The Common Forms<i class="material-icons">filter_vintage</i></h1>
<p>As the last of these articles, what are the common forms? The common forms are the transcendent ideals of self, the damning view of the void, the perception of nothingness that is not nothingness, and the beauty of the world as something we can ascend to. The Forms are platonic, the common forms are this contradictory and discursive conversation of the below.</p>
