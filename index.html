    <h2>An Incomplete
    Manifesto For Growth</h2>
    <p>Bruce Mau, 1998</p>
  </div>
<ol>
<li>1. Allow events to change you. You
have to be willing to grow. Growth is
different from something that happens
to you. You produce it. You live it. The
prerequisites for growth: the openness
to experience events and the
willingness to be changed by them.</li>
<li>2. Forget about good. Good is a
known quantity. Good is what we all
agree on. Growth is not necessarily
good. Growth is an exploration of unlit
recesses that may or may not yield to
our research. As long as you stick to
good you’ll never have real growth.</li>
<li>3. Process is more important than
outcome. When the outcome drives
the process we will only ever go to
where we’ve already been. If process
drives outcome we may not know
where we’re going, but we will know
we want to be there.</li>
<li>4. Love your experiments (as you
would an ugly child). Joy is the engine
of growth. Exploit the liberty in casting
your work as beautiful experiments,
iterations, attempts, trials, and errors.
Take the long view and allow yourself
the fun of failure every day.</li>
<li>5. Go deep. The deeper you go the
more likely you will discover something
of value.</li>
<li>6. Capture accidents. The wrong
answer is the right answer in search of
a different question. Collect wrong
answers as part of the process. Ask
different questions.</li>
<li>7. Study. A studio is a place of study.
Use the necessity of production as an
excuse to study. Everyone will benefit.</li>
<li>8. Drift. Allow yourself to wander
aimlessly. Explore adjacencies. Lack
judgment. Postpone criticism.</li>
<li>9. Begin anywhere. John Cage tells us
that not knowing where to begin is a
common form of paralysis. His advice:
begin anywhere.</li>
<li>10. Everyone is a leader. Growth
happens. Whenever it does, allow it
to emerge. Learn to follow when it
makes sense. Let anyone lead.</li>
<li>11. Harvest ideas. Edit applications.
Ideas need a dynamic, fluid, generous
environment to sustain life Applications,
on the other hand, benefit from
critical rigor. Produce a high ratio of
ideas to applications.</li>
<li>12. Keep moving. The market and its
operations have a tendency to reinforce
success. Resist it. Allow failure
and migration to be part of your practice.</li>
<li>13. Slow down. Desynchronize from
standard time frames and surprising
opportunities may present themselves.</li>
<li>14. Don’t be cool. Cool is conservative
fear dressed in black. Free yourself
from limits of this sort.</li>
<li>15. Ask stupid questions. Growth is
fuelled by desire and innocence.
Assess the answer, not the question.
Imagine learning throughout your life
at the rate of an infant.</li>
<li>16. Collaborate. The space between
people working together is filled with
conflict, friction, strife, exhilaration,
delight, and vast creative potential.</li>
<li>17. ___________. Intentionally left blank.
Allow space for the ideas you haven’t
had yet, and for the ideas of others.</li>
<li>18. Stay up late. Strange things happen
when you’ve gone too far, been up
too long, worked too hard, and you’re
separated from the rest of the world.</li>
<li>19. Work the metaphor. Every object
has the capacity to stand for something
other than what is apparent.
Work on what it stands for.</li>
<li>20. Be careful to take risks. Time is genetic.
Today is the child of yesterday and
the parent of tomorrow. The work you
produce today will create your future.</li>
<li>21. Repeat yourself. If you like it, do it
again. If you don’t like it, do it again.</li>
<li>22. Make your own tools. Hybridize
your tools in order to build unique
things. Even simple tools that are your
own can yield entirely new avenues of
exploration. Remember, tools amplify
our capacities, so even a small tool
can make a big difference.</li>
<li>23. Stand on someone’s shoulders.
You can travel farther carried on the accomplishments
of those who came before
you. And the view is so much better.</li>
<li>24. Avoid software. The problem with
software is that everyone has it.</li>
<li>25. Don’t clean your desk. You might
find something in the morning that
you can’t see tonight.</li>
<li>26. Don’t enter awards competitions.
Just don’t. It’s not good for you.</li>
<li>27. Read only left–hand pages.Marshall
McLuhan did this. By decreasing the
amount of information, we leave room
for what he called our “noodle”.</li>
<li>28. Make new words. Expand the
lexicon. The new conditions demand a
new way of thinking. The thinking
demands new forms of expression. The
expression generates new conditions.</li>
<li>29. Think with your mind. Forget technology.
Creativity is not device–dependent.</li>
<li>30. Organization = Liberty. Real innovation
in design, or any other field,
happens in context. That context is
usually some form of cooperatively
managed enterprise.
Frank Gehry, for instance, is only able
to realize Bilbao because his studio
can deliver it on budget. The myth of a
split between “creatives” and “suits”
is what Leonard Cohen calls a
“charming artifact of the past.”</li>
  <li>31. Don’t borrow money. Once again,
Frank Gehry’s advice. By maintaining
financial control, we maintain creative
control. It’s not exactly rocket science,
but it’s surprising how hard it is to
maintain this discipline, and how
many have failed.</li>
<li>32. Listen carefully. Every collaborator
who enters our orbit brings with him
or her a world more strange and complex
than any we could ever hope to
imagine. By listening to the details and
the subtlety of their needs, desires, or
ambitions, we fold their world onto our
own. Neither party will ever be the same.</li>
<li>33. Take field trips. The bandwidth of
the world is greater than that of your
TV set, or the Internet, or even a totally
immersive, interactive, dynamically rendered,
object–oriented, real–time, computer
graphic–simulated environment.</li>
<li>34. Make mistakes faster. This isn’t my
idea—I borrowed it. I think it belongs
to Andy Grove.</li>
<li>35. Imitate. Don’t be shy about it. Try
to get as close as you can. You’ll never
get all the way, and the separation
might be truly remarkable. We have
only to look to Richard Hamilton and
his version of Marcel Duchamp’s large
glass to see how rich, discredited, and
underused imitation is as a technique.</li>
<li>36. Scat. When you forget the words,
do what Ella did: make up something
else… but not words.</li>
<li>37. Break it, stretch it, bend it, crush it,
crack it, fold it.</li>
<li>38. Explore the other edge. Great
liberty exists when we avoid trying to
run with the technological pack. We
can’t find the leading edge because
it’s trampled underfoot. Try using
old–tech equipment made obsolete by
an economic cycle but still rich with
potential.</li>
<li>39. Coffee breaks, cab rides, green
rooms. Real growth often happens
outside of where we intend it to, in the
interstitial spaces—what Dr. Seuss
calls ‘the waiting place.’ Hans Ulrich
Obrist once organized a science and
art conference with all of the infrastructure
of a conference—the parties,
chats, lunches, airport arrivals—but
with no actual conference. Apparently
it was hugely successful and spawned
many ongoing collaborations.</li>
<li>40. Avoid fields. Jump fences.
Disciplinary boundaries and regulatory
regimes are attempts to control the
wilding of creative life. They are often
understandable efforts to order what
are manifold, complex, evolutionary
processes.Our job is to jump the
fences and cross the fields.</li>
<li>41. Laugh. People visiting the studio
often comment on how much we laugh.
Since I’ve become aware of this, I use
it as a barometer of how comfortably
we are expressing ourselves.</li>
<li>42. Remember. Growth is only
possible as a product of history.
Without memory, innovation is merely
novelty. History gives growth a
direction. But a memory is never
perfect. Every memory is a degraded
or composite image of a previous
moment or event. That’s what makes
us aware of its quality as a past and
not a present. It means that every
memory is new, a partial construct
different from its source, and, as such,
a potential for growth itself.</li>
<li>43. Power to the people. Play can only
happen when people feel they have
control over their lives. We can’t be
free agents if we’re not free.</li>
